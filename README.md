# mTLS Java Client

Successfully and statelessly invoke a mTLS endpoint using your Private Key and Certificate from plain String with no environment setup.

This is a code reference for you to copy, not a dependency lib.

## Getting Started

Quickly check this working:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/labbsr0x/mtls-java-client.git
docker-compose up --build
```

This will bring 2 containers up: one with Java8 client and another with Java11.

Those are pure Java8 and Java11 components, so you don't need to download any dependencies to use them.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
